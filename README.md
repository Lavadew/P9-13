Phishing emails remain one of the most widespread threats in cybersecurity, often deceiving users into sharing sensitive information such as passwords and financial details. While advanced detection methods exist, they can appear inaccessible to beginners due to their heavy reliance on complex models. Our project addresses this gap by creating a hybrid phishing detection system that combines machine learning with rule-based heuristics. This approach not only leverages predictive models for accuracy but also applies transparent, logical rules for explainability, giving users both statistical confidence and clear reasons behind each decision.

The goal of this project is to build a phishing detection tool that uses both machine learning and simple rules. The machine learning part gives predictions, while the rules make the results easier to explain. Together, the system should be accurate and beginner-friendly.
